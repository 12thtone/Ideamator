# The Ideamator

This iOS 8 app is called The Ideamator. The user creates an idea, rates the idea's quality (noteTag), and views the created ideas 
on a UITableView. The ideas can be searched, read, shared, and edited.
* Search uses UISearchController.
* Ideas are saved using Core Data.
* Share ideas using UIActivityViewController.
* Import ideas using Document Picker.
